The package thermo-user is intended for the user to use the facilities
provided by the thermophysics&chemistry package.

The package :thermo is intended for the development of the package.

* Thermodynamic coefficients

The thermodynamic coefficients, such as S, Cp, H are provided by two
types of utilities, based on NIST's webbook: formulas using the
Shomate coefficients, or data interpolation tables.

One can use either the defaults or specify explicity which method.  This is illustrated below for the calculation of H2 specific heat.

The shomate coefficients are stored in the thermo-data directory, in
files such as H2.shomate using a lisp format.

Janaf coefficients are stored in the janaf directory, in files such as
H2.dat using a txt format.

For most coefficients, we have included the valid temperature range,
and if the requested temperature falls outside of it, a condition is
thrown
