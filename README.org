System for calculating thermophysical and thermochemical coefficients

* Overview

Functions for calculating:
 - thermodynamic coefficients (Cp, S, etc)
 - transport-coefficients (viscosity, thermal conductivity)
 - collision integral (Omega) formulas

   
Tables of coefficients or data for calculating the above.  The various
coefficients are calculated using fits or interpolations.

All internal calculations and all results are in SI.

* Status

  Fairly stable.  New features added as needed.

** Future plans
    I want to re-factor some of the features, such as collision
    integrals.
