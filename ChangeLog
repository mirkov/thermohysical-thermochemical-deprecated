	* src/tc-external-interface.lisp (Cv): For species for which no
	method is defined, I try calculating Cp and then subract N kb (see
	doc).
	(Cv): Added unit tests against CRC tables

	* src/kt-transport-coeffs.lisp (mu-0 lambda-0): Fixed calling
	structure to lj-coeffs and to omega-22 (now called omega-22* to
	better conform to the start notation for reduced collision
	integrals.
	(): Added unit tests for mu-0 and lambda-0 based on lennard-jones
	calculations.  The test for lambda-0 for N2 fails because the
	conductivity is off by a factor of 1.25, while it is correct for
	Ar.

	* src/thermo-data.asd (:thermo-data): Added
	`constant-thermo-coeffs' file to the `thermodynamic-coefficients'
	module

	* src/constant-thermo-coeffs.lisp (Cv): Added informative message
	to assert form

	* src/lennard-jones-coeffs.lisp (make-LJ-coeffs): Exporting m and
	sigma.  I need to rethink symbol exporting since some of them (m
	for example) are exposing the internals of the lj class.

2011-08-15  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* src/package-def.lisp (:thermo): using collision-integrals symbols

	* src/hs-collision-integrals.lisp (Omega11-hs): Implemented to be
	similar to the prior definition in the gas-kinetic package.  The
	Kee formula is flaky (see function documentation).
	Added unit tests

	* src/collision-integrals-defaults.lisp, src/collision-integrals-package-def.lisp:
	Changed omega-11,22 to omega-11-22* (the star signifies a reduced
	collision integral)

	* src/lennard-jones-coeffs.lisp: Added `doc' slot for data
	traceability.  But the rest of the code does not yet allow for
	full traceability
	(make-lj-coeffs): Hardcoded the data source.  Needs to be fixed in
	a later release.

	* src/kt-transport-coeffs.lisp (lambda-0): Removed `with-slots'
	binding to `Cv'.  That must have been an error

	* src/hs-collision-integrals.lisp: Imported hard-sphere code from
	gas-kinetic formulary and adapted to this package

	* src/thermo-data.asd (:thermo-data): Removed dependency on
	lennard-jones-coeffs.lisp
	(:thermo-data): Restored dependency on constant-coeff.lisp.  Not
	sure when I lost that.

	* src/lennard-jones-coeffs.lisp: Moved to collision integrals package:
	- symbol exports
	- Reading the coefficients file
	- print-object (new method)

	* src/collision-integrals-package-def.lisp (:collision-integrals):
	Added imports from alexandria and my-utils for lennard-jones-coeffs.lisp

	* src/collision-integrals.asd (:collision-integrals): Added
	"lennard-jones-coeffs.lisp and my-utils package dependency (the
	latter for polyeval)

2011-08-14  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* src/defaults-setup.lisp: Removed references to collision-integrals

	* src/package-def.lisp (:thermo): Added dependency on
	:collision-integrals

	* src/thermo-data.asd (:thermo-data): Removed
	collision-integrals.lisp, added collision-integrals package as a
	prerecquisite

	* src/hs-collision-integrals.lisp: New file part of collision
	integrals package

	* src/lj-collision-integrals.lisp: New file part of collision
	integrals package

	* src/collision-integrals-defaults.lisp: New file part of
	collision integrals package

	* src/collision-integrals-package-def.lisp: New file part of
	collision integrals package

	* src/collision-integrals.asd: Start of refactoring collision
	integrals out of the package

2011-08-11  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* src/janaf-coefficients.lisp (initialize-instance): Added
	explicit binding of *array-type* as 'foreign-array. 

2011-08-10  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* src/janaf-coefficients.lisp (janaf-coeff): Method specialized on
	column number, I had temperature specialized as double-float.
	THis is not a valid class in clisp.  Added conditional code for
	clisp and sbcl.
	(read-janaf-table%): Addapted call to mv-grid-utils:read-grid to
	new calling convention

	* src/environment-setup.lisp (*data-directory*)
	(*janaf-directory*): Modified home path definition to take into
	account on which machine the code is running

	* README.org: Cleaned up

	* doc/user-documentation.org: Created file.  Right now it contains junk.
