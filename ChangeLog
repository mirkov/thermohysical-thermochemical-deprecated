	* src/thermo-data.asd (:thermo-data): Removed dependency on
	lennard-jones-coeffs.lisp
	(:thermo-data): Restored dependency on constant-coeff.lisp.  Not
	sure when I lost that.

	* src/lennard-jones-coeffs.lisp: Moved to collision integrals package:
	- symbol exports
	- Reading the coefficients file
	- print-object (new method)

	* src/collision-integrals-package-def.lisp (:collision-integrals):
	Added imports from alexandria and my-utils for lennard-jones-coeffs.lisp

	* src/collision-integrals.asd (:collision-integrals): Added
	"lennard-jones-coeffs.lisp and my-utils package dependency (the
	latter for polyeval)

	* src/defaults-setup.lisp: Removed references to collision-integrals

	* src/package-def.lisp (:thermo): Added dependency on
	:collision-integrals

	* src/thermo-data.asd (:thermo-data): Removed
	collision-integrals.lisp, added collision-integrals package as a
	prerecquisite

	* src/hs-collision-integrals.lisp: New file part of collision
	integrals package

	* src/lj-collision-integrals.lisp: New file part of collision
	integrals package

	* src/collision-integrals-defaults.lisp: New file part of
	collision integrals package

	* src/collision-integrals-package-def.lisp: New file part of
	collision integrals package

	* src/collision-integrals.asd: Start of refactoring collision
	integrals out of the package

	* src/janaf-coefficients.lisp (initialize-instance): Added
	explicit binding of *array-type* as 'foreign-array. 

2011-08-10  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* src/janaf-coefficients.lisp (janaf-coeff): Method specialized on
	column number, I had temperature specialized as double-float.
	THis is not a valid class in clisp.  Added conditional code for
	clisp and sbcl.
	(read-janaf-table%): Addapted call to mv-grid-utils:read-grid to
	new calling convention

	* src/environment-setup.lisp (*data-directory*)
	(*janaf-directory*): Modified home path definition to take into
	account on which machine the code is running

	* README.org: Cleaned up

	* doc/user-documentation.org: Created file.  Right now it contains junk.
